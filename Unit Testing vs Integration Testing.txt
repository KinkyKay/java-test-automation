						UNIT TESTING VS INTEGRATION TESTING
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
Normally a software application is developed by a team of many people. So while
developing an application is divided into different modules and modules are
divided into different developers of the team. When a single developer writes
some code, let's say a common function, and test that function then this type 
of testing is called Unit Testing. When all the different modules are developed
and integrated then testing is required to check if the complete application is 
working properly or not after integrating different modules. This type of 
testing is called Integration Testing.

Difference between Unit Testing and integration Testing:
	$ Unit Testing
		$$ Unit testing is a type of testing to check if the small piece of
		   code or a single function is doing as per the expectation
	    $$ It checks a single component/function of the application
	    $$ Its scope is very limited
	    $$ It should have no dependencies on code outside its definition
	    $$ This is the first type of testing is to be carried out in the
		  software testing life cycle and generally executed by the developer.
	    $$ The goal of Unit testing is to test each unit separately and ensure
		  that each unit is working as expected.
	    $$ Unit testing comes under the White-box testing type.
	   
    $ Integration Testing
		$$ Integration testing is a type of testing to check if different
		   modules are working as expected after integrating each other.
	    $$ It checks the overall flow of the application, after the integration
		   of different modules
	    $$ Its scope is very wide
		$$ This type of testing can have each element in the software application
		$$ This is performed after unit testing. Generally, the script is
		   preferred to test the integration testing
		$$ Integration testing is further divided into different types as follows:
		   Top-down integration, Bottom-up Integration, etc
	    $$ Integration testing is coming under both Black-box and White-box type
		   of testing
