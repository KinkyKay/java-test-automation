						TEST AUTOMATION - MOCKITO
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
In complex classes, a unit test often needs to instantiate and configure a lot
of objects. The set-up is time-consuming and the test may turn out to be more
complicated than the tested code itself. In these cases, mockito framework is
particularly useful. It allows you to create a special object known as mock
and define its behavior during execution.

To include mockito library into your project using Maven build system, use the
following templates and replace VERSION with the actual library version of 
your repository:
			<dependency>
				<groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
				<artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
				<version>VERSION</version>
				<scope>test</scope>
			</dependency>
