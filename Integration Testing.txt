								INTEGRATION TESTING
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------//
Integration testing is a way of testing software by grouping software components
together. In a complex software system, there are numerous interconnections 
applicable to a particular feature, which makes writing integration tests 
difficult.

In this workflow, we have test input data that is provided to a system
component A, which then interacts with components B and C. The result of the
output is then verified with the expected output.
